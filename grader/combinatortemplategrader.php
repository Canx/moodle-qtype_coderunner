/* The qtype_coderunner_combinator_template_grader class. This isn't actually a

 * combinator template to generate a mark and the feedback to the student in
 * a single run. The output is not split into separate test runs, so the normal
 * interface does not apply. See the doCombinatorGrading method of the question
 * class.
